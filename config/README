About the defaults.json file:

The config/defaults.json file in this directory provides default
configuration values that may be used at runtime, at built time,
or both.  In general, one should always re-run build processes (e.g.
building .css files from .scss) after changing any data in that 
configuration file.

The content of the config/defaults.json file must describe an object
containing a "defaults" key, and the value of the "defaults" key must
be an object representing a map of settings and values.

The settings are available from within php code in a nested
associative array accessible via
`$GLOBALS[ 'BONES_THEME_CONFIG' ][ wp_get_theme()->get('TextDomain') ][ 'defaults' ]`


Settings:

background:
  color:
    The default background color to show when no background color has
    been specifically configured.  This should be a string containing
    the hexadecimal color value without a leading "#" character.


Side notes:

In order to support defining colors according to the Sass best
practices while at the same time storing the values in a
configuration file, we would actually need to be able to cross-
reference one configuration variable from another.  That (along with
inline comments) is something that YAML supports, but JSON does not.

Unfortunately for us, YAML is not compiled into php by default, so
we should avoid depending on that.  If we stick with JSON, then we
might want to introduce our own convention for specially formatted
string values that refer to the paths of other values within the JSON
data.  In that case, we'll need to write cide to dereference those
strings in both php and in Ruby (for SASS processing) though.
